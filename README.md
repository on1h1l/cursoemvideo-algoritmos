# Algorithms Practice Repository

Learning in public — documenting progress one exercise at a time.

## 🎯 Purpose

- practice logic and problem solving
- build consistency through daily exercises
- track my learning progress over time

## 📚 About

This repository contains algorithm exercises developed during my programming studies.

Exercises are added gradually as I progress through my learning path.
Some exercises may be grouped in a single commit when completed in the same study session.

Files with the `-ref` suffix in the `aulas` folder correspond to the original versions provided by the course and are kept solely as references for behavior comparison.

## ⏱️ Study Method

- short focused study sessions
- one concept at a time
- practice after studying
- review whenever something is not clear

## 🧭 Note

Currently focused on building strong programming fundamentals.
